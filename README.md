SAY MY NAME PROJECT

Backend in Python
1. In this project the development in python uses different libraries such as openpyxl, eng_to_ipa, pyttsx3 and G2p. We have used Visual Studio Code as our IDE.
   The command to install these libraraies are:
   // convert text to speech
      pip install pyttsx3
  
  // Reading excel in python
      pip install openpyxl

  // converting to phonetics
      pip install eng_to_ipa

  // G2p installation
      pip install g2p
2. If using VSCode as IDE then to run the code first open the terminal.
   In the VScode go to the options -> terminal -> new terminal
3. For running the code, go to the extreme left column -> run and debug -> select python as language and click ok.
4. The code will now run in the terminal and the ouput will also be seen in the console.


Frontend
1. For the frontend we have used Angular, typescript, javascript, HTML/HTML5, CSS and bootstrap.
2. To run the code, download the SayMyNameProjectFrontend folder.
3. After that go into that folder and open command prompt from that path.
4. Install node modules by using the command "npm install". Node modules are responsible to install all the packages a library requires.
5. After that again open the command prompt in the same path, and to run the application type "ng serve" OR "ng s" in the command prompt.
6. By default the angular application will run on the 4200 port.
7. The application will now be running on this url "http://localhost:4200/"
